# AmongUsBot
This is the new Among Us bot that I created

Features:
-> Call your friends for Among Us anytime you like
-> Just the game code and server name is enough
-> The bot would inform if there are enough players to start the game

How to use it?
-> Download the zip file of this repository
    => On top right of the page find an option called "code" with a download symbol
    => Click on it and download zip file

-> Find an "AmongUs.py" file
-> Open that file and run it
-> Now the bot would get activated

Errors:
-> If you get any errors such as: module Discord not found:
    => Open cmd (if you are in windows)
    => Type pip install discord.py
    
    => Open Terminal (if you are on mac on linux)
    => Type sudo apt-get install python3-discord.py or pip3 install discord.py
 
-> For any other errors found, please feel free to post it in the issues column here

# THANK YOU!
